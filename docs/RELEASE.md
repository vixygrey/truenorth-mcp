# Release & Publishing Guide

Package: [bigpowers on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bigpowers)

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup (one-time)

```bash
# Add NPM_TOKEN to GitHub Secrets
# → GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# → New secret: NPM_TOKEN (from npmjs.org → Access Tokens)

# Commit setup
git add .github/ .releaserc.json .gitmessage package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: add semantic-release automation"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Making Releases

**Just commit with conventional messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(new-skill): add orchestrate-project skill"
git commit -m "fix(sync-skills): handle missing directories"
git push origin main
```

**Automatically:**
- ✅ Analyzes commits
- ✅ Bumps version (semver)
- ✅ Updates CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Creates git tag (v1.2.3)
- ✅ Publishes to npm
- ✅ Creates GitHub Release

### 3. Check Release Status

```bash
# View Actions
# GitHub → Actions → Release workflow

# View published version
npm view bigpowers

# View releases
# GitHub → Releases
```

## Per-Project Semver Convention (v2.0.0)

When using bigpowers to build a *project* (not the bigpowers package itself), the recommended semver lifecycle is:

| Stage | Version | How |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Pre-delivery | `0.0.0-β` | Initial state after `seed-conventions` |
| Each `feat:` story lands | `0.1.0`, `0.2.0`, … | `semantic-release` minor bump |
| Developer declares MVP | `1.0.0` | Allow the `1.0.0` tag in release config |
| Post-MVP features | `1.1.0`, `1.2.0`, … | Normal semver from Conventional Commits |

> This keeps all pre-MVP work in the `0.x.x` range, making the `1.0.0` tag a meaningful project milestone rather than an arbitrary number.

---

## Commit Message Format

**Required for automatic releases:**

```
feat(scope): description          # Minor version bump (0.1.0 → 0.2.0 or 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
fix(scope): description           # Patch version bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
docs: description                 # No version bump
```

**Examples:**
```
feat(skills): add new craft-skill command
fix(sync): handle edge case in directory creation
docs: update README with examples
feat(develop-tdd)!: redesign test structure  # Major bump (BREAKING)
```

See `.github/COMMIT_TEMPLATE.md` for full format.

## Manual Release (Local)

For full semantic-release (GitHub + npm + changelog):

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)
export NPM_TOKEN=[from npmjs.org]

npm run release
```

To publish the current `package.json` version to npm only:

```bash
npm publish
```

## Version History

All releases in:
- `CHANGELOG.md` — generated from commits
- GitHub → Releases — GitHub release page
- `npm view bigpowers versions` — all npm versions

## Troubleshooting

**No release created after push?**
→ Commits may not follow conventional format
→ Check Actions log: GitHub → Actions → Release workflow

**"ENOAUTH" error?**
→ Verify NPM_TOKEN in GitHub Secrets

**Want to skip release for a commit?**
→ Add `[skip ci]` in commit message:
```
chore: update docs [skip ci]
```

## Architecture

- `.releaserc.json` — configuration
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow
- `.gitmessage` — commit template (optional)
- `package.json` — version source of truth
- `CHANGELOG.md` — auto-generated release notes


## v3.0 Launch Note — Semantic Bridge

The v3.0 "Semantic Bridge" release ships the **public receipts page** as its
centerpiece: a live evidence dashboard at `/receipts` that renders bigpowers'
own quality metrics — each with provenance and freshness. Every section degrades
to "not yet measured" — this page never fabricates a number.

See the [receipts page](https://danielvm-git.github.io/bigpowers/receipts/) for live data.
