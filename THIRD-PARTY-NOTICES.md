## skills/simple-english — ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English synthesis

The `simple-english` skill is a synthesis of three MIT-licensed skills. It
combines the strongest parts of each into one canonical skill, rewritten to
pass this repo's own STE gate and adapted to the truenorth-mcp skill format.

  clauses, semicolons, Latin abbreviations, slop words, trailing conditions,
  synonym rotation).
