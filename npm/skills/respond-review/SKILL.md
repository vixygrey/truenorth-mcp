# Respond Review

> **HARD GATE**: every reviewer comment MUST be addressed. Fix it, disagree and document the reason, or ask for clarification. Do NOT ignore feedback and merge.

Work through reviewer findings systematically. Don't apply changes blindly — categorize first, then decide, then fix, then verify.

## Process

### 1. Read the full review report

Read every finding before acting on any of them. Get the full picture first.

### 2. Categorize findings

For each finding, assign a category:

| Category       | Meaning                                                                     | Action                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **must-fix**   | A correctness bug, a security issue, a test failure, a convention violation | Fix before proceeding |
| **should-fix** | Code quality issue, naming, clarity — worth fixing but not blocking         | Fix if time allows    |
| **consider**   | Architectural suggestion, alternative approach — may or may not apply       | Discuss with user     |

Create a numbered list of all findings with their categories.

### 3. Confirm with user (for consider-category items)

For each "consider" item, briefly describe the trade-off and ask: "Apply, skip, or discuss?"

### 4. Apply must-fix items first

Fix every must-fix item. For each one:

- Describe what you're changing and why
- Make the change
- Run the verify command if one exists for this area

### 5. Apply should-fix items

Apply should-fix items. If any are large enough to warrant their own commit, note them separately.

### 6. Run the full suite

After all changes are applied:

```bash
<full test command>
<typecheck command>
<lint command>
```

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No type errors
- [ ] No lint violations

### 7. Report

Summarize what was applied and what was skipped:

```
Applied (must-fix): #1, #2, #3
Applied (should-fix): #4
Skipped (consider): #5 — agreed with user to defer
All tests pass.
```

Suggest next skill: `commit-message`.
