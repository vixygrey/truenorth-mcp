// story: e80s05
// Positive fixture: IDOR / missing tenant scoping (must be flagged).
//
// Modelled on a real-world bug family (BUG-129/130/133/135/136/140/143): the
// handler authenticates the caller, then trusts an ID from the request and
// queries by that ID alone. Authentication is proven; authorization is not.
// Nothing in the type system or a diff-scoped review makes this look wrong —
// the bug is a predicate that was never written.
