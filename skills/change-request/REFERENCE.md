# WSJF Scoring Reference

Weighted Shortest Job First: **WSJF = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size**

All dimensions scored 1–10 using a Fibonacci-like scale: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10.

## Business Value

| Score | Meaning                                               |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 10    | Core revenue path, legal requirement, blocking launch |
| 8     | Significant user value, major pain point removed      |
| 5     | Notable improvement, medium user segment affected     |
| 3     | Nice-to-have, minor convenience                       |
| 1     | Cosmetic or speculative                               |

## Time Criticality

| Score | Meaning                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 10    | Hard deadline (regulatory, contract, launch date) |
| 8     | Competitive window closing, partner dependency    |
| 5     | Would delay next milestone if deferred            |
| 3     | Flexible, can slip one sprint                     |
| 1     | No urgency                                        |

## Risk Reduction (or Opportunity Enablement)

| Score | Meaning                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10    | Eliminates critical architectural risk or enables a new capability |
| 8     | Reduces a known failure mode or unblocks high-value work           |
| 5     | Moderate risk mitigation or enablement                             |
| 3     | Low risk reduction                                                 |
| 1     | No risk relevance                                                  |

## Job Size (effort denominator — larger = lower WSJF)

| Score | Meaning  |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | Hours    |
| 2     | 1 day    |
| 3     | 2–3 days |
| 5     | 1 week   |
| 8     | 2 weeks  |
| 10    | 1 month+ |

## Cut threshold

Stories with WSJF < 1.5 are cut candidates: high effort, low combined value.

## Example

Story: "Add OAuth login"
- Business Value: 8 (removes major sign-up friction)
- Time Criticality: 5 (Q3 launch nice, not hard)
- Risk Reduction: 3 (minor security improvement)
- Job Size: 5 (one week)

WSJF = (8 + 5 + 3) / 5 = **3.2** — healthy, implement early.
