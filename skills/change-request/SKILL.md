# Change Request

> **HARD GATE** — `specs/release-plan.yaml` must exist before running either mode. If it doesn't, run `plan-release` first.

> → verify: `test -f specs/release-plan.yaml`

Two modes. State which one you want or the skill will ask.

## Mode A — Add

Intake a new requirement mid-flight without disrupting work in progress.

1. **Capture**: What is the change? What problem does it solve?
2. **Locate**: Which existing stories in `specs/epics/` does it affect or replace?
3. **Draft**: Add story + `tasks[]` with Gherkin-style AC in epic YAML (each task has `verify`). Tag requirement deltas: `ADDED` / `MODIFIED` / `REMOVED` / `RENAMED` with before/after for non-`ADDED` changes (e45s29).
4. **Place**: Append story under existing epic capsule, or create `specs/epics/eNN-slug.yaml` and register in `release-plan.yaml` `epics[]`.
5. **Score**: Compute WSJF; note if it outranks in-progress work.

→ verify: `grep -c 'stories:' specs/epics/*/epic.yaml`

## Mode B — Reorder

Value-engineering pass over the full release using WSJF.

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the full WSJF scoring rubric.

1. **Score** each epic/story: BV + TC + RR / Job Size.
2. **Re-sort** `release-plan.yaml` `epics[]` and per-epic `wsjf` fields.
3. **Flag cut candidates**: WSJF < 1.5.
4. **Update** `specs/release-plan.yaml` and epic `wsjf` keys with rationale.
5. **Report** the delta.

→ verify: `grep -c 'wsjf' specs/release-plan.yaml specs/epics/*/epic.yaml`

## Conversational Mode

If the user's request is in natural language and does not match the structured format of Mode A or Mode B, enter Conversational Mode to extract the change parameters through interactive dialogue.

### 5-Step Flow

1. **Capture**: Parse the natural-language request for what, why, and where. Ask at most 3 clarifying questions before drafting.
2. **Locate**: Identify which epic or capability in `specs/epics/` the request affects or replaces.
3. **Draft**: Present a structured draft of the proposed story and tasks for user confirmation.
4. **Score**: Estimate the WSJF score and explain the calculation so the user understands the priority.
5. **Place**: Confirm the final epic placement with the user before writing files.

## After either mode

Update `specs/execution-status.yaml` from the epic manifests. Suggest `plan-work` or
`build-epic` for the top-ranked unstarted story.
