## Output file formats

### Story spec (task group directory: `.agent/tasks/<capsule>/`)

Populated countable-story-format with all 20 sections. Minimum maturity: 3 (Countable). Acceptance criteria in §17.

### Task checklist (task group directory: `.agent/tasks/<capsule>/`)

```yaml
story_id: e01s01
title: Login
status: failing
bcps: 3
tasks:
  - id: 1
    description: 'Add login form component tests'
    verify: 'npm test -- login-form.test.tsx'
    risk: P1
    status: failing # flip to passing only after verify exits 0 (e45s06)
    allure:
      severity: high # P0→critical, P1→high, P2→normal, P3→minor
      categories:
        - 'Auth'
        - 'Security Review'
```

**Allure severity mapping:**

- `P0` → `critical`
- `P1` → `high`
- `P2` → `normal`
- `P3` → `minor`

`categories` is a list of relevant tags — wave names, test categories (e.g. `"unit"`, `"integration"`), or thematic groupings (e.g. `"Security Review"`).

Update the `.agent/tasks/<capsule>/group.yml` manifest to list the story and its BCPs. Update `.agent/tasks/execution-status.yml` after structural changes.

## Plan template

```
### Story [X.Y]: [title] — Implementation Steps

**type:** feat | fix | refactor
**risk:** P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
**context:** domain | infra
**Context**: [One paragraph: what this story implements and why]

## Steps

1. [Step description] (ref: ADR-NNNN or commit SHA) → verify: `<runnable command>`
2. [Step description] (ref: ADR-NNNN or commit SHA) → verify: `<runnable command>`
...

## Verification Script (Step-by-Step)

[A human-readable, step-by-step script for the user to verify the story's outcome.]

1. [Action 1: e.g. Start the server]
2. [Action 2: e.g. Open browser to http://localhost:3000]
3. [Observation: e.g. Verify that the login modal appears]

## Out of scope

- [Explicit exclusions]

## Risks

- [Anything that could go wrong and how to detect it early]
```

## Verify step format rules

Every step MUST follow this exact format:

```
N. <What to do> → verify: <runnable command that proves it worked>
```

**Good examples:**

```
1. Add User model with email and name fields → verify: npm test -- user.test.ts
2. Add POST /users endpoint → verify: curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/users -d '{"email":"a@b.com"}' | jq .id
3. Add email uniqueness constraint → verify: npm test -- user-uniqueness.test.ts
```

**Bad examples (no verify command):**

```
1. Implement the user creation flow
2. Write tests for the API
```

## Sub-operations

### Risk Assignment Heuristics

Every task and story MUST be assigned a `risk:` level (P0, P1, P2, P3). When the test plan note exists for the task group, defer to its scenario risk mapping (`SC-eNNsYY-P0-NN`). Otherwise, apply these heuristics based on BCP and story type:

- **P0**: Critical path, data loss risk, auth/security boundary, external integration, or high BCP (≥ 5).
- **P1**: Core feature logic, state mutations, standard business value (BCP 3-4).
- **P2**: Utility functions, UI layout changes, display-only data, low risk (BCP 2).
- **P3**: Documentation, cosmetic tweaks, CSS variables, zero behavioral change (BCP 1).

`verify-work` scales its UAT depth based on this field.

### Requirement delta tags (e45s29)

When modifying existing behavior in story spec § Requirements:

```markdown
#### MODIFIED: User can reset password via email link

**Before:** Password reset required admin approval.
**After:** Self-service reset via signed email link (expires 1h).

#### REMOVED: Legacy OAuth1 login

**Before:** OAuth1 provider supported for enterprise SSO.
**After:** (removed) — provider deprecated; OAuth2 only.
```

Tags: `ADDED`, `MODIFIED`, `REMOVED`, `RENAMED`. `MODIFIED`/`REMOVED`/`RENAMED` without before/after → plan-work gate FAIL.

### Define Success

Before planning, convert task statements into observable "step → verify: <cmd>" pairs:

- Break the task into observable outcomes (behaviors) rather than implementation steps
- Write pairs in the format: `[What must be true] → verify: <runnable command>`
- Challenge completeness: are all required behaviors covered?
- Get user confirmation: "Does this capture everything the task requires?"
- Once confirmed, these pairs become the skeleton for plan-work steps

### Zoom-Out Check

When modifying an existing module, confirm scope is understood:

- State the module's **purpose** — what is it responsible for?
- Name the **callers** — who depends on it?
- List the **contracts** — what invariants or interfaces must be preserved?

If you cannot answer all three without deep code archaeology, scope is misunderstood. Clarify with the user before writing steps.

### Slopcheck

For every external package proposed in the plan, tag each with one of:

- `[OK]` — package is mature, actively maintained, appropriate scope
- `[SUS]` — suspiciously broad, has maintenance concerns, or unclear fit
- `[SLOP]` — unmaintained, known security issues, or out of scope

`[SUS]` and `[SLOP]` require explicit human approval before the step may execute. Document tags inline next to the package name.
