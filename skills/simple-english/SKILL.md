Use it for documentation, a README, a runbook, a procedure, an error message, release notes, an incident report, or an API guide. Also use it when the user says "STE", "Simplified Technical English", "ASD-STE100", "de-slop", "make this readable", or asks for docs that translate well.

# Simple English

> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT deliver technical text without classifying it first as procedural or descriptive. Every sentence limit and verb form depends on this choice.
>
> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT change code, identifiers, CLI flags, file paths, or quoted error messages. Leave them exact.
>
> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT claim STE compliance. State that final approval rests with the writer.

Write technical text with the rules of ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. STE removes long sentences, synonym rotation, and decorative clauses so a tired reader cannot misread an instruction.

## Your task

When asked to write or rewrite technical text, do these steps in order:

1. Select mode (**Pragmatic** default for docs/READMEs; **Strict** when user requests full STE/compliance).
2. Classify each passage as procedural or descriptive.
3. Fix vocabulary before drafting (pick one verb/noun per concept).
4. Apply core limits and rules from REFERENCE.md.
5. Run mandatory self-check before delivery.
6. Leave code, identifiers, and quoted errors untouched.

When asked to CHECK text, report each violation with rule number, offending text, and compliant rewrite.

## Passage classification

|                | Procedural (instructions)          | Descriptive (explanations)                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose        | Tell the reader what to do         | Explain what a thing is or does                      |
| Verb form      | Imperative: "Install the pump."    | Simple present, past, or future                      |
| Sentence limit | **20 words** (Rule 5.1)            | **25 words** (Rule 6.3)                              |
| Unit rule      | One instruction per sentence (5.2) | One topic per paragraph (6.5), max 6 sentences (6.6) |

## Core limits

| Limit                                                                                      | Rule          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Max 20 words per procedural sentence / 25 words per descriptive sentence or note           | 5.1, 6.3, 5.5 |
| Max 6 sentences per paragraph; multi-word nouns max 3 words                                | 6.6, 2.1      |
| Approved verbs: infinitive, imperative, simple present/past/future, past participle as adj | 3.2           |
| Active voice; no semicolons; put required conditions before commands                       | 3.6, 8.1, 5.4 |
| Code, numbers with units, identifiers, quoted text count as 1 word each                    | 8.6           |

## Approved modals & slop replacements

Approved modals: `can`, `will`, `must`. Replace `should` → `must` (requirement) or delete (recommendation); `may`/`might`/`could` → `can`.

Common slop replacements: `leverage`/`utilize` → `use`; `in order to` → `to`; `prior to` → `before`; `ensure` → `make sure that`; `functionality` → `function`/`feature`. See full table in REFERENCE.md.

## Self-check before delivery

1. Count words in 3 longest sentences (over limit → split).
2. Search draft for contractions, perfect tenses, banned modals, `-ing` verbs after comma, semicolons.
3. Check `if`/`when` placement (must start sentence before command).
4. Verify consistent single term per concept across whole doc.
