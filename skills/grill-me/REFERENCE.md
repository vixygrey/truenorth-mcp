# Docs Mode — Full Process

Triggered by "grill me with docs" or when a plan depends on a specific library or external API.

**Why this matters:** AI agents hallucinate API methods, argument orders, and behaviors. Every assumption about an external dependency must be validated against the actual docs before code is written.

## Step 1 — Identify the dependencies

From the plan or conversation, list:

- Every external library being used
- Every third-party API being called
- Every framework behavior being relied upon

Ask: "Which of these are you most confident about? Which are you less sure of?"

## Step 2 — Fetch the relevant docs

For each dependency, fetch the actual documentation:

```
WebFetch the official docs for [library/API]
```

Prioritize:

- The API reference for the specific method being used
- The changelog for the version in use (breaking changes)
- Migration guides if upgrading from a previous version
- Known gotchas / FAQ sections

## Step 3 — Challenge each assumption

For every assumption in the plan, find the corresponding doc section and ask:

- "Does the real API actually work this way? Show me the doc."
- "Is this method available in the version you're using?"
- "Does this argument order match the actual signature?"
- "Are there rate limits, quotas, or timeout behaviors that affect this design?"
- "Is this marked as deprecated in the current version?"

Ask one question at a time. For each challenge, cite the specific URL and section.

## Step 4 — Surface hallucinations

When an assumption doesn't match the docs:

> "Your plan uses `library.doThing(a, b)` but the [docs](https://example.com/api-reference) show the signature is `doThing(config: {a, b})` with a config object. This will fail at runtime."

Document each discrepancy clearly.

## Step 5 — Update the plan

For each confirmed discrepancy, recommend a concrete fix:

- Correct method signature
- Correct argument order
- Alternative approach that matches what the library actually supports
- Whether a spike (`spike-prototype`) is needed to validate a remaining uncertainty

## Step 6 — Sign off

When all major assumptions have been validated against docs, report:

- Which assumptions were confirmed ✓
- Which were corrected ✗ + what the correct approach is
- Which remain uncertain → recommend `spike-prototype`
