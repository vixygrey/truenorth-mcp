# Compose Workflow

> **HARD GATE**: a workflow is orchestration, not automation. Do NOT create a workflow for a task that should be a single skill. The workflow complexity must be justified.

## Process

1. Interview: goal, phases, which skills, gates between steps.
2. Write the workflow recipe:
   - `name`, `command`, `description`, `skills[]`, `verify`
   - Optional: `args` for skill-specific arguments
3. Register in state.yaml Active Decisions.
4. Optional: reference from `orchestrate-project` Ad-Hoc mode.

> **Prefer the YAML recipe format** over the legacy workflow markdown format.
> YAML recipes are command-mappable, machine-readable, and listed in the Standard Recipe Library.

## Terminal-state taxonomy (e45s27)

Every workflow step and `/loop` tick MUST exit with exactly one terminal state:

| State       | Meaning                                                     | Next action                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `success`   | Step verify passed; artifacts written                       | Advance to next skill in recipe      |
| `no-op`     | Nothing to do (already green / already applied)             | Skip step; advance                   |
| `blocked`   | External gate (approval, red CI, missing dep)               | `diagnose-stall` or escalate to user |
| `exhausted` | Max iterations/cycles reached (review cap, dispatch cycles) | Stop; human decision required        |

Record terminal state in `.agent/tasks/state.yml` `handoff.last_terminal_state` when a recipe step completes. `/loop` ticks that produce no progress for two consecutive wakes → invoke `diagnose-stall`.

## Standard Recipe Library

Pre-built workflow recipes map agentic stack commands to skill chains.
Reference them in AGENTS.md so `/command` directly invokes the matching recipe.

| Command        | Workflow    | Skill chain                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/check-stack` | check-stack | survey-context → assess-impact → setup-environment           |
| `/ship`        | ship        | audit-code → commit-message → release-branch                 |
| `/tdd`         | tdd         | develop-tdd → enforce-first                                  |
| `/code-review` | code-review | audit-code → request-review → respond-review                 |
| `/security`    | security    | audit-code → request-review                                  |
| `/plan`        | plan        | survey-context → research-first → plan-work                  |
| `/build-fix`   | build-fix   | investigate-bug → diagnose-root → develop-tdd → validate-fix |
| `/e2e`         | e2e         | smoke-test → verify-work                                     |

Add to `AGENTS.md`:

```
/check-stack = compose-workflow check-stack
/ship        = compose-workflow ship
```

## Verify

→ verify: the workflow recipe exists and lists at least one skill in `skills[]`.

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for template.
