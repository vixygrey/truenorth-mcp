# Audit Plan

> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT start build skills (kickoff-branch, develop-tdd) until audit-plan returns a READY verdict. A plan missing test commands, scope boundaries, or success criteria will produce drift and rework downstream.

Assess an incoming project plan for alignment with the project principles, identify what is missing, and produce a structured readiness report before any skill execution begins.

## Three lenses

### 1. Principles alignment

- Are stories vertical slices (not horizontal layers)?
- Is scope bounded — explicit in_scope + out_of_scope?
- Are success criteria defined (how do we know we're done)?
- Are HARD GATE candidates identifiable (critical decision points)?
- Is there a domain language / ubiquitous terminology?

### 2. Conventions completeness

- Does `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` exist?
- Does `CONVENTIONS.md` exist?
- Is the `specs/` directory layout in place?
- Are commit conventions documented (Conventional Commits)?
- Is the git workflow mode identified (`solo-git` | `team-pr`)?

### 3. Pre-flight (must all be answered before build)

| Question                             | Why                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What is the **test command**?        | `develop-tdd` verify steps require it                                |
| What is the **build command**?       | `verify-work` mechanical gate                                        |
| What is the **lint command**?        | `audit-code` lint gate                                               |
| What is the **typecheck command**?   | `verify-work` typecheck gate                                         |
| What **CI platform** is in use?      | `wire-ci` configuration                                              |
| **Solo or team**?                    | `release-branch` integration mode                                    |
| Primary **language and framework**?  | conventions and tooling                                              |
| **Greenfield or existing** codebase? | determines whether to run `seed-conventions` or `migrate-spec` first |

## Process

1. **Ingest the plan** — accept a file path, pasted PRD text, or existing `specs/` artifacts. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` if present.

2. **Score each lens** — for every item above, mark:
   - ✅ Present and adequate
   - ⚠️ Present but incomplete — note what's missing
   - ❌ Absent

3. **Close gaps conversationally** — for each ❌ or ⚠️, ask one question at a time. Record each answer before moving to the next.

4. **Write the plan audit report**:

```markdown
# Plan Audit — <project>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Verdict:** READY | NOT READY

## Principles Alignment

| Check | Status | Note |
| Vertical slices | ✅ | 4 stories, each shippable |
| Scope bounded | ⚠️ | in_scope present; out_of_scope missing |

## Conventions Completeness

| Check | Status | Note |

## Pre-flight Answers

| Command | Value |
| test | `npm test` |
| build | `npm run build` |

## Open Gaps

- [ ] Add out_of_scope to scope definition (run scope-work)
- [ ] Create the project agent guide (run seed-conventions)

## Verdict

READY — proceed with survey-context
NOT READY — N gaps remain; close before proceeding
```

5. **Recommend next skill**:
   - READY → `survey-context`
   - Needs bootstrapping → `seed-conventions`
   - Needs spec elaboration → `elaborate-spec`
   - Has foreign spec format → `migrate-spec`
   - Plan assumptions need challenging → `grill-me`

## Verify

→ verify: the plan audit report exists and includes a `Verdict` line.
