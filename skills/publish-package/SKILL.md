# Publish Package

> **HARD GATE** — Do not attempt to publish without verifying prerequisites. Missing auth tokens, stale builds, or duplicate versions cause CI failures that are hard to debug post-push.
>
> **HARD GATE** — Always run `--dry-run` first. Package registries are append-only — a bad publish cannot be fully undone on most registries.

Publish packages to language-specific registries. Detects package type from manifest files, verifies publish prerequisites, runs the registry-specific publish command, and confirms the version appears on the registry.

## Process

### 1. Detect package type

Read the project root for manifest files to determine the package type:

| Manifest                      | Registry  | Publish command                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---- | ------ |
| `package.json`                | npm       | `npm publish --access public`                 |
| `Cargo.toml`                  | crates.io | `cargo publish`                               |
| `setup.py` / `pyproject.toml` | PyPI      | `twine upload dist/*` or `flit publish`       |
| `Formula/<name>.rb`           | Homebrew  | `brew bump-formula-pr`                        |
| Multiple detected             | Polyglot  | Error: specify registry with `--registry <npm | crates.io | pypi | brew>` |

If no manifest is found, prompt the user to specify the type or pass `--type <npm|crates.io|pypi|brew>`.

### 2. Verify prerequisites

Before attempting any publish, run all applicable checks:

**npm (`package.json`):**
See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

**crates.io (`Cargo.toml`):**
See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

**PyPI (`setup.py` / `pyproject.toml`):**
See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

### 3. Run publish

After all prerequisite checks pass, run the registry-specific command:

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

### 4. Verify publish success

After publish, confirm the version appears on the registry:

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

### 5. Error handling

On failure, surface actionable hints:

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

### 6. Dry-run mode (`--dry-run`)

Run `--dry-run` to verify all prerequisites without actually publishing:

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

### 7. Dry-run mode per registry

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

### 8. Tag-driven publishing

When the project publishes from CI, prefer a tag-driven release over a manual
publish. A `v*` tag triggers the release workflow, which builds and publishes. Use
a manual publish only for a registry the workflow does not cover.

## Verify

Confirm the dry-run passes for the detected registry before any real publish. A
successful dry-run reports the package and version that would publish.
