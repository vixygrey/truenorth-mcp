# Run Benchmark

> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT use benchmark scores to declare a skill "good" or "bad" in isolation. Benchmarks measure relative quality vs. a baseline — they catch regressions, they do not certify correctness.

Reads benchmark definitions from `specs/benchmarks/`, executes each scenario's grader with and without the skill loaded, and writes a structured `pass@k` report with delta grading that `evolve-skill` consumes.

## With/Without-Skill Delta Grading

Every scenario runs N times (default 3) in two modes: with the skill loaded and
without (a bare agent with only the project conventions). The delta
`Δ = pass@k_with − pass@k_without` isolates the skill's causal contribution. A
negative delta is a regression flag.

## Train/Validation Split

Benchmark definitions partition scenarios into two sets:

| Set            | Tag                 | Purpose                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Train**      | `split: train`      | Development scenarios — used while iterating. Hitting 100% on train is expected.                              |
| **Validation** | `split: validation` | Held-out scenarios — the real quality signal. Overfitting train while validation stagnates is a design smell. |

`pass@k` is reported separately for train and validation. Validation score is authoritative; train score is iteration guidance only.

## Usage

Run the benchmark for a single skill, for all skills with a definition, or in
baseline mode to pin the results as the baseline.

## Process

1. **Locate the definition** — read the benchmark definition for the skill. When
   absent, stop with a message.

2. **Partition the scenarios** — split by the `split` field (`train` for iteration,
   `validation` for the authoritative signal, default `validation`).

3. **Run each scenario (N-run delta)** — for each scenario, run the grader N times
   (default 3):
   - Without the skill: an agent with only the project conventions.
   - With the skill: an agent with the skill under test active.
   - Code grader: run the command, exit 0 is a PASS. A 15-second timeout.
   - Rubric grader: yes or no per criterion, 80% yes or more is a PASS.
   - Record the with-and-without results per scenario.

4. **Calculate scores** — Per split (train, validation) and mode (with, without):
   - `pass@k = sum(weight × pass_rate) / sum(weights)` where `pass_rate = passes/runs`
   - `Δ = pass@k_with − pass@k_without` — causal contribution
   - Round to 2 decimal places

5. **Write benchmark.json** to `specs/benchmarks/reports/benchmark-<skill>.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "skill": "survey-context",
     "run_date": "2026-06-22",
     "runs_per_scenario": 3,
     "train": {
       "with_skill": 0.92,
       "without_skill": 0.67,
       "delta": 0.25,
       "scenarios": ["s01", "s02"]
     },
     "validation": {
       "with_skill": 0.83,
       "without_skill": 0.6,
       "delta": 0.23,
       "scenarios": ["s03", "s04", "s05"]
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Write YAML report** to `specs/benchmarks/reports/BENCHMARK-<skill>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   skill: survey-context
   run_date: '2026-06-22'
   runs_per_scenario: 3
   train:
     pass_at_k_with: 0.92
     pass_at_k_without: 0.67
     delta: 0.25
   validation:
     pass_at_k_with: 0.83
     pass_at_k_without: 0.60
     delta: 0.23
   scenarios:
     - id: s01
       split: train
       with_pass_rate: 1.0
       without_pass_rate: 0.67
       delta: 0.33
       weight: 1.0
   ```

7. **Baseline** (`--baseline`) — Copy to `BASELINE-<skill>.yaml` + `baseline-<skill>.json`.

8. **Compare to baseline** — `IMPROVED: Δ 0.17 → 0.25` / `REGRESSION: Δ 0.25 → 0.17 — do NOT ship` / `STABLE`.

9. **Delta threshold gate** — Validation Δ < 0.0 blocks release. Δ < 0.05 warns (marginal). Min meaningful threshold: 0.05.
