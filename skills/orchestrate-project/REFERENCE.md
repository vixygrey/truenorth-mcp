# Orchestrate Reference: Phases, Modes, and Workflows

Detailed documentation for the `orchestrate-project` meta-skill.

## The 6-Phase Core Loop

### PHASE 1: DISCOVER

- **Goal**: Understand the problem completely and map existing context.
- **Deliverables**: `requirements/VISION_LATEST.yaml`, `requirements/SCOPE_LATEST.yaml`, `plans/TECH_STACK_LATEST.md`.
- **Skills**: `survey-context`, `elaborate-spec`, `grill-me`.
- **Gate**: Confirm ("Is the problem clear?").

### PHASE 2: ELABORATE

- **Goal**: Research solutions and lock architectural design.
- **Deliverables**: Prior art in scope YAML, ADRs in `specs/adr/`.
- **Skills**: `grill-me`, `model-domain`, `define-language`, `deepen-architecture`, `design-interface`.
- **Gate**: Quality ≥94% (via `request-review`) + Confirm ("Are decisions locked?").

### PHASE 3: PLAN

- **Goal**: Write a verifiable implementation plan with success criteria.
- **Deliverables**: `release-plan.yaml`, `epics/eNN-*.yaml` with `verify:` per task.
- **Skills**: `scope-work`, `slice-tasks`, `plan-work`.
- **Gate**: Quality (request-review ≥94%) + slopcheck [SUS]/[SLOP].

### PHASE 4: BUILD

- **Goal**: Execute the plan story-by-story using the 8-step `build-epic` cycle with TDD and vertical slices.
- **Deliverables**: Code; `execution-status.yaml` updated per story; `specs/metrics/cycle-times.yaml` row per story.
- **Skills**: `build-epic` (conductor) → per-story: `survey-context`, `plan-work`, `kickoff-branch`, `develop-tdd`, `verify-work`, `audit-code`, `commit-message`, `release-branch`.
- **BCP tracking**: `plan-release` sizes each story in Business Complexity Points (BCP) before the build queue. `plan-work` confirms and writes the size to `state.yaml` as `epic_cycle.story_bcps`.
- **Timestamps**: `survey-context` stamps `metrics.story_start`; `release-branch` stamps `metrics.story_end` and writes BCP/hr to `specs/metrics/cycle-times.yaml`.
- **next_skill**: Each critical-path skill writes `handoff.next_skill` to `state.yaml`. Agents resume by reading `state.yaml` — no guessing.
- **Dashboard**: `npm run dashboard` (TUI) or `npm run dashboard:web` (browser, port 7742) shows live pipeline, epic queue, BCP metrics, and cycle-time ledger.
- **Gate**: Integration tests PASS; all 8 build-epic steps completed per story.

### PHASE 5: VERIFY

- **Goal**: Validate success criteria and ensure production readiness.
- **Deliverables**: UAT evidence, eval results.
- **Skills**: `run-evals`, `verify-work`, `audit-code`, `request-review` (optional).
- **Gate**: Verification Script confirmed; `verify-work` not on `main`/`master`.

### PHASE 6: RELEASE (Integrate)

- **Goal**: Ship to `main` with full traceability.
- **Deliverables**: Release tag (vX.Y.Z), release notes via the tag-driven release (a `v*` tag triggers the release workflow).
- **Skills**: `commit-message`, `release-branch`.
- **Git arc**:
  1. Plan on `main` (Discover / Plan)
  2. `kickoff-branch` → worktree + feature branch + clean baseline
  3. Build / Verify / Review on feature branch
  4. Integrate: **solo-local** (automated branch-landing path) or **team-pr** (`gh pr create` → squash merge)
  5. Cleanup worktree; **end on `main`** in primary repo root
- **Gate**: Safety ("About to land on main. Confirm?").

## Orchestration Modes

### Mode 1: Standard (Enforce All Gates)

**Use Case**: New features, major refactors, architectural changes.
**Behavior**:

- All Confirm gates require explicit user approval.
- All Quality gates are hard stops if threshold is not met.
- No shortcuts or phase skipping.

### Mode 2: Fast-Track (Skip Negotiable Gates)

**Use Case**: Hotfixes, minor improvements, refactors on well-tested code.
**Behavior**:

- Skip Discover if `requirements/SCOPE_LATEST.yaml` exists.
- Skip Elaborate if design decisions are already locked.
- Skip Verify if coverage ≥95% + all tests PASS.
- Soft gates auto-approve if baseline conditions are met.

### Mode 3: Ad-Hoc (Legacy, Warnings Only)

**Use Case**: Exploration, prototyping, spikes (NOT for production).
**Behavior**:

- Gates emit warnings but do not block execution.
- User can manually skip any phase.
- No enforced quality thresholds.

## Gate & Checkpoint Types

_The gate types and the checkpoint keys are defined in this reference._

- **Confirm**: Requires human "yes/no" decision.
- **Quality**: Automated threshold check (e.g., coverage, audit score).
- **Safety**: Destructive actions require risk acknowledgment.
- **Transition**: Mandatory artifact presence check.
- **slopcheck**: Identification of [SUS] (Suspicious) or [SLOP] (High-risk) packages.

## Error Recovery & State

Orchestrate maintains `specs/state.yaml` to track:

- **Current flow / epic**: `active_flow`, `active_epic_id`, `epic_cycle`.
- **Handoff**: `last_step_completed`, `open_decisions`, `required_reading`, `next_skill`.
- **Git**: `branch`, `hash` for session continuity.
- **Progress**: Story status lives in `execution-status.yaml` only.

In the event of a crash or exit, resume the orchestrate skill to pick up exactly where the session left off.
